# Realty Listing Snooper

This is a project to use Realty website APIs to track changes to listings throughout their lifetimes.

## Why?

Wouldn't it be useful to see trends over time e.g. price drops/rises, listing removal + re-addition, number of listings for a given area...Often this kind of data is missing or unreliable (easily manipulated) if provided by a website's UI and only really retrievable by someone who has access to the MLS.

## How?

This project is also doubling as an excuse to try the Go language.
